# Being a hero

Being heroic is the ability to conjure hope where there is none. To strike a match to light up the void. When all of the odds are against you and you still achieve victory.

That's what a hero is. because the universe does not care about anything in the infinite expanse of space and time the universe does not care whether your mother’s hip

replacement goes well or whether your kids attend college or not. Only you care about yourself, your family and friends and the things that you like.

## Hope and hopelessness

In our lives, something needs to matter because without something mattering, then there’s no reason to go on living.

The opposite of hope and happiness is not anger or sadness. If you’re angry or sad, that means you still give a fuck about something. That means something still matters and you still have hope.

The opposite of happiness is hopelessness, an endless gray horizon of resignation and indifference. It’s the belief that everything is fucked, so why do anything at all? Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction.

If you dive deep into hopelessness you'll become a Nihilist. Nihilism is the believe that nothing in this world matters and there is no point in living.

## Building and maintaining hope

To build and maintain hope, we need three things:

- A sense of control. Control means we feel as though we’re in control of our own life, that we can affect our fate.
- A belief in the value of something. Values means we find something important enough to work toward, something better, that’s worth striving for.
- A community. Community means we are part of a group that values the same things we do and is working toward achieving those things.
