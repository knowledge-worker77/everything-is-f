# **Teach love by actually loving**

One of the best ways to teach your children about love and respect is to give him love and respect. And you don’t force the love or trust or respect on him after all, that would make those things conditional you simply give them, understanding that at some point, the adolescent’s bargaining will fail and he’ll understand the value of everything when he's ready.

## Feelings sell

In our modern economy if you want to sell something don't tell people about the nice features that your product has but tell them about how it will uplift their social status and then your product will sell like hotcakes.
