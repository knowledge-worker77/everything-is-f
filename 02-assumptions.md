# Assumptions and problems

The Classic Assumption says that if a person is undisciplined, unruly, or malicious, itâ€™s because he lacks the ability to subjugate his feelings, that he is weak-willed or just plain fucked up.

The Classic Assumption sees passion and emotion as flaws, errors within the human psyche that must be overcome and fixed within the self.

We can fix our problems by getting our values straight with ourselves so that we can get our values straight with the world.

Every single problem is a problem with your self-control and not about discipline or reason but it's because all problems that we face because of self-control are due to our emotions.

- Self-control is an emotional problem.
- Laziness is an emotional problem.
- Procrastination is an emotional problem
- Underachievement is an emotional problem
- Impulsiveness is an emotional problem.

## Emotional gravity

Each person has an emotional gravity in there bodies and minds and we only attract those thing or those people that align with our poles. And, according to the laws of magnetism we will repel any thing or any one that doesn't align with our beliefs.
