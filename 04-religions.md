# Religions

In our world you might think that there are only a few religions that exist but that is not the truth. In the modern day world whatever thing gets the people most hyped up about becomes a their religion. There are many kinds of religions and there are many *types* of religions in the modern day world.

- **Spiritual religions:** Spiritual religions draw hope from supernatural beliefs, or belief in things that exist outside the physical or material realm. These religions look for a better future outside this world and this life. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, animism, and Greek mythology are examples of spiritual religions.
- **Ideological religions:** Ideological religions draw hope from the natural world. They look for salvation and growth and develop faith-based beliefs regarding this world and this life. Examples include capitalism, communism, and fascism.
- **Interpersonal religions:** Interpersonal religions draw hope from other people in our lives. Examples of interpersonal religions include romantic love, children, sports heroes, political figures.

## The master and slave morality

In Newtonian terms, master morality is the intrinsic desire to create a moral separation between ourselves and the world around us. It is the desire to create moral gaps with us on top.

Slave morality is,then, an intrinsic desire to equalize, to close the moral gap and alleviate suffering. Both are fundamental components of our Feeling Brainâ€™s operating system.
