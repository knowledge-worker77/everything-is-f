# The two brains

Each person has two different types of brains in his head that reside in his consciousness. A Thinking Brain and a Feeling Brain.

The Thinking Brain represents your conscious thoughts, your ability to make calculations, and your ability to reason through various options and express ideas through language. The Feeling Brain represents your emotions, impulses, intuition, and instincts.

While your Thinking Brain is calculating payment schedules on your credit card statement, your Feeling Brain wants to sell everything and run away to Tahiti.

Each of your two brains has its strengths and weaknesses:

- The Thinking Brain is conscientious, accurate, and impartial.
- The Feeling Brain, arrives at its conclusions quickly and effortlessly. The problem is that it is often inaccurate and irrational.

## Moral gaps

A moral gap is the feeling you have about a person and what that person deserves.

If someone treats you nicely, you'll develop a positive moral gap and will think that this person deserves better than you and if someone punches you in the face, you'll develop a negative moral gap and would want bad things to happen to that person.
